      A <strong>Blockchain</strong> is a <mark>distributed ledger</mark> with
      growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via
      cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
      represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the
      previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data
      structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
      <del>Consequently</del> Continuosly, blockchain transactions are
      irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
      cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
      <br />
      <br />
      Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network
      for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to
      a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
      Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks
      are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify
      a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
      1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
      by Mutually Suspicious Groups. <sup>[10]</sup> " Further work on a
      cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart
      Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. <sup>[4][11] </sup> They wanted to implement
      a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992,
      Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the
      design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document
      certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company
      Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in
      <i> The New York Times</i> every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or
      group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the
      design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp
      blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and
      introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks
      are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year
      by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it
      serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.
      <sup> [3]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of
      all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB
      (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and
      from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB
      to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[15]
      <br />
      <br />
      The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's
      original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word,
      blockchain, by 2016. <sup>[16]</sup>

    <h2>Structure and design</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital
      ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record
      transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be
      altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent
      blocks.[3][20] This allows the participants to verify and audit
      transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[21] A blockchain
      database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a
      distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
      collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[22] Such a design
      facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data
      security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic
      of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each
      unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem
      of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange
      protocol.[23] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when
      properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record
      that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup
        >[24]</sup
      >
      <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[25] and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Blocks</h3>
    <p>
      Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into
      a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior
      block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a
      chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous
      block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the
      genesis block (Block 0).<sup>[26][27]</sup> To assure the integrity of a
      block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.
      <sup> [28]</sup>
    </p>
    <h4>Block time</h4>
    <p>
      The <i>block time</i> is the average time it takes for the network to
      generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block
      completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this
      is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time
      means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between
      14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.
      <sup>[33]</sup>
    </p>
    <h4>Hard forks</h4>
    <p>
      <i
        >This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) ยง Hard fork.[edit]</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>hard fork</i> is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not
      backward compatible and requires all users to upgrade their software in
      order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the
      network splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules
      and one that follows the old rules.
